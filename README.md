Fundational-of-Computation
============================

 Coursera & RiceU Specialization 
All code are writing in Python and using platform [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org), an online Python development tool created by one of the professors, Scott Rixner.

This respository contain all of project during taking this course in the summer, 2016

Tool
------------
* [Python 2.7](http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/) (they'll probably work in Python 3, but they need a bit of adjusting)
* [SimpleGUITk](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimpleGUITk) library - the course uses a custom library called Simplegui, but that library is only available in [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org)
* [SimpleGUICS2Pygame](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SimpleGUICS2Pygame) - an alternative to SimpleGUITk; used in week 8 because SimpleGUITk on Linux has some problems with loading sound files from URLs

Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python [Part1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1) & [Part2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2) 
------------

The goal of this course is to teach you to learn python language and how to use it in the real world from project weekly and quiz every half week.

Mini-Projects description:

* Week 1: Rock, paper, scissors, lizzard, Spock - a gentle introduction to python and conditionals
* Week 2: Guess the number - introduces the "frame", input fields and events
* Week 3: Stopwatch - introduces the timer and the canvas, and string manipulation
* Week 4: Pong - who doesn't love Pong? Introduces drawings to canvas and collisions. Also, introduces a bit the concept of lists and touples
* Week 5: Memory - nice card game; teaches you how to draw images on the canvas
* Week 6: Black jack - you know what it is
* Week 7: Spaceship - things get serious. You'll learn about movement, friction, sprite animation
* Week 8: Rice-rocks - the final projects is an adaptation of a game called [Asteroids](http://www.play.vg/games/4-Asteroids.html).
